  <h1 font size="20"><center> Bhagat Singh </h1>  


<pre width="10%"><FONT SIZE="6">Bhagat Singh was born on 28th September 1907 at Lyallpur district (now in Pakistan) to a patriotic father,
Kishan Singh who was in jail even at the time of his birth. His uncle, Sardar Ajit Singh was a great freedom 
fighter who established Indian Patriot’s Association.

Thus, patriotism was in his blood. He was associated with many revolutionary organizations and played a key 
role in the Indian Nationalist Movement. He is often called as “Shaheed Bhagat Singh” as the supporters and 
followers of this legendary accorded him the title of “Shaheed” meaning “Martyr” after he sacrificed his life for 
the nation. He became a prominent leader of the “Hindustan Social republican Association” in the year 1928.

Singh was greatly attracted towards Socialism and because of his inclination towards transformation of Indian 
Society post independence; he set the path for a political alternative which most revolutionaries didn’t think of. 
He had a clear vision and dedication of the purpose in accomplishment of his goals.

He completed his schooling at Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School. In D.A.V. School, Bhagat was influenced by his 
two of his teachers, Bhai Parmanand and Jai Chand Vidyalankar who were true nationalists and left an impression 
in Bhagat’s mind.

Bhagat Singh had very clear thoughts and openly defied British. He burnt the school books sponsored by the 
government and participated in Gandhiji’s Non-cooperation movement. He also supported Khadi and burnt foreign 
cloth. He left studies at the age of thirteen and joined the freedom struggle.

The tragic and violent incident of ”Chauri-Chaura” made Gandhi call off the Non- cooperation movement, as it had 
gone against his principles of non-violence or “Ahimsa”. Bhagat Singh associated himself with the Indian
Revolutionary Movement after this. He expressed his unwillingness to marry when his parents tried to plan 
his marriage while he was pursuing B.A.

His only aim was to free India from the slavery of British. He established contacts with members of Kirti 
Kisan Party. He contributed regularly to the magazine “Kirti.” The Jalianwala Bagh tragedy in 1919 left a scar 
in Bhagat’s mind which leads to the formation of the Naujawan Bharat Sabha appointing Young Indians and became 
its Secretary in March, 1926.

Since his belief was in revolution to win freedom, he joined hands with Chandra Shekhar Azad who was a 
revolutionary. He continued to relentlessly work and form association with more and more revolutionaries to 
trigger the opposition against the British.

When Simon Commission came to India in February 1928, it was boycotted by Indians because the committee headed by 
Sir John Simon had no Indians in the deciding committee.

Lala Lajpat Rai, launched the “Simon go back” protest moving towards Lahore Railway Station and raised black flags 
to condemn a committee that was to decide freedom and responsibilities of Indians. Lalaji died after being hurt in 
a Lathi charge during the protest. Bhagat Singh along with Sukhdev and Rajguru, two other revolutionaries decided 
to avenge Lalaji’s death and assassinated Saunders, mistaking him for Scott, the police officer who had ordered 
the lathi to be charged on Lalaji. To escape the arrest he got his beard and hair cut in order to avoid 
any recognition. He and his other associated in the revolution learnt to make crude bombs from Jatinder Das Nath.

In 1926, he along with Kundan Lal and Azad planned to rescue the prisoners of Kakori Case, but they failed 
and exploded a bomb in Lahore on Dussehra the same year. But they were released due to lack of evidence. He 
even threw two bombs at the Central Legislative Assembly, with Bakuteshwar Dutt and shouted slogans of 
“Inquilab Zindabad” The intention of throwing the bomb was not to hurt or kill anyone and the only purpose was 
to express disagreement to the ordinance of the Defence of Indian Act that was to be formulated. Both of 
them surrendered following the blasts. He was also sentenced to 116 days in jail on account of these charges and 
continued to demand equal rights for Indian and British Prisoners in the jail. This helped him gain 
widespread national support.

Bhagat Singh along with Sukhdev and Rajguru was interrogated British Authority and convicted with the murder of 
J.P. Saunders. Singh was fearless and admitted the murder and even made accusations against the British rule 
during his trial for the murder.

Bhagat Singh openly opposed the discrimination that was made between the British and Indian prisoners and 
went against the dual policy of treatment. He even went on hunger strike with fellow prisoners to express 
resentment. British were forced to accept the demands and agree to their conditions, after a month of long
 strike. He was finally convicted with murder of Saunders and for the Assembly bomb attack and hence ordered 
death sentence along with revolutionaries Sukhdev and Rajguru.

On March 23, 1981, all three of them were hanged to death in Lahore. The cremation of Singh alone was done on 
the banks of Sutlej River in Hussainiwala.

Bhagat Singh is fondly remembered as “Shaheed-E-Azam” an infused spirits in the youth of slave India to 
become heroes and not fear anything when struggling for the nation. The courage that he exhibited was also 
a source of power for other freedom strugglers including Mahatma Gandhi to fight and win the freedom 
struggle. He had a keen mind and intellect that made him a leader in many revolutions.

Even though Bhagat didn’t believe in purely non-violent ways of achieving freedom, he also opposed terrorism 
and wanted the masses to mobilize the struggle.

The slogan of “Inquilab Zindabad” which was started by Bhagat later became the war cry in the struggle of 
Indian Independence.

People of India, still pay tribute to this great hero who readily gave up his life to pave the path for 
independence of his nation from foreign rulers. The nation celebrates his birth anniversary every year 
with great pride and fervor.</pre>
